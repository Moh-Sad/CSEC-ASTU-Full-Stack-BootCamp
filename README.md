## Day 3: HTML, CSS, Flexbox, and Grid

On Day 3, we learned about the **basics of HTML and CSS**, their definitions, structure, and use. Here's a quick summary:  
- **HTML**: The standard language for creating web pages, defining their structure and content.  
- **CSS**: Used for styling HTML elements, making web pages visually appealing.  

### Key Topics:
- **Flexbox and Grid**: Techniques for creating flexible and responsive layouts.  
- **Responsive Design**: Ensuring websites look good and function well on various devices and screen sizes.

We also solved **practice exercises** to strengthen our understanding of these concepts.

## Day 5: Basics of JavaScript and ES6 Features

Today, we dove into the basics of **JavaScript** and explored the features introduced in **ES6**. Here's a summary of what we learned:

### Key Concepts:
- **Scope in JavaScript**:  
  - **Global Scope**: Variables accessible from anywhere in the code.  
  - **Local Scope**: Variables declared within a block, function, or module, limited to that context.  

- **let vs. const vs. var**:  
  - **let**: Block-scoped, can be reassigned.  
  - **const**: Block-scoped, must be initialized and cannot be reassigned.  
  - **var**: Function-scoped, has hoisting behavior.

- **Logical Operators**:  
  - **== (Equality Operator)**: Compares values after type coercion.  
  - **=== (Strict Equality Operator)**: Compares values without type coercion (checks both value and type).  

### Tasks and Exercises:
- Solved a **swapping variables** task.  
- Practiced **verbal and practical problem-solving** by answering and implementing JavaScript-related questions.

This hands-on practice helped reinforce our understanding of JavaScript's foundational concepts. Looking forward to building more interactive applications as we progress!

## Day 6: JavaScript DOM Manipulation

On Day 6, we explored the **Document Object Model (DOM)** and learned how to manipulate it using JavaScript.  

### Key Topics Covered:
- **Understanding the DOM**: The structured representation of HTML as nodes and objects.  
- **DOM Methods**:  
  - **querySelector**: Selects the first matching element.  
  - **querySelectorAll**: Selects all matching elements.  
  - **getElementById**: Selects an element by its ID.  
  - **getElementsByClassName**: Selects elements by their class name.  

- **Event Handling**:  
  - **onclick**: Handling click events dynamically.  

### Practical Exercises:
- Practiced changing **innerHTML** dynamically using **onclick** and **querySelector**.  

### Task Pending:
- We will complete a task to create an interactive feature where users input email and password details, and JavaScript validates and displays them dynamically using DOM manipulation.

## Day 11: Introduction to React and Building Simple Components

On **Day 11**, we took a significant step forward in our Full-Stack Development journey by diving into **React**, one of the most popular and powerful front-end libraries. Here's a summary of what we covered:

---

### **What is React?**
- **React** is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, developed and maintained by **Facebook** (now Meta).  
- It allows developers to create reusable **components** to build dynamic and interactive web applications.  
- React uses a **virtual DOM** to efficiently update and render components, making it highly performant.

---

### **Key Concepts Covered:**
1. **Components**:  
   - React applications are built using **components**, which are reusable, self-contained pieces of UI.  
   - Components can be **functional** (using functions) or **class-based** (using classes).  

2. **Creating a React App**:  
   - We used **Create React App** (CRA), a tool that sets up a React project with a single command.  
   - Command:  
     ```bash
     npx create-react-app my-app
     ```  
   - This generates a boilerplate project with all the necessary configurations.

3. **JSX (JavaScript XML)**:  
   - JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows us to write HTML-like code within JavaScript.  
   - It makes React components more readable and easier to write.  

4. **React Virtual DOM**:  
   - React uses a **virtual DOM** to optimize rendering.  
   - Instead of directly manipulating the browser's DOM, React creates a lightweight copy (virtual DOM) and updates only the parts of the UI that change.  

5. **Props (Properties)**:  
   - **Props** are used to pass data from one component to another.  
   - They are read-only and help make components dynamic and reusable.

---

### **Tasks and Exercises:**
1. **Creating a React App**:  
   - We initialized a new React project using **Create React App** and explored the file structure.  

2. **Building a Simple Card Component**:  
   - Created a **Card component** that displays user information (e.g., name, image, description).  
   - Used **props** to pass data dynamically to the Card component.  

3. **Rendering Multiple Cards**:  
   - Rendered multiple instances of the Card component by mapping over an array of data.  

---

### **Code Example:**
Hereâ€™s a simple example of the **Card component** we built:

```jsx
import React from 'react';

function Card(props) {
  return (
    <div className="card">
      <img src={props.image} alt={props.name} />
      <h2>{props.name}</h2>
      <p>{props.description}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Card;
```

And in the **App component**, we rendered multiple cards:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import Card from './Card';
import './App.css';

function App() {
  const users = [
    { name: 'John Doe', image: 'https://via.placeholder.com/150', description: 'Software Developer' },
    { name: 'Jane Smith', image: 'https://via.placeholder.com/150', description: 'UI/UX Designer' },
    { name: 'Mike Johnson', image: 'https://via.placeholder.com/150', description: 'Data Scientist' },
  ];

  return (
    <div className="App">
      <h1>User Cards</h1>
      <div className="card-container">
        {users.map((user, index) => (
          <Card key={index} name={user.name} image={user.image} description={user.description} />
        ))}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

---

### **Highlights:**
- It was exciting to see how React simplifies building dynamic and reusable UI components.
- The concept of **props** and **component-based architecture** made it clear why React is so powerful for front-end development.  
- The **virtual DOM** explanation helped us understand how React optimizes performance.  

---

### **Next Steps:**
- Dive deeper into **state management** and **event handling** in React.  
- Explore **React hooks** like `useState` and `useEffect` to add interactivity to our applications.  
- Build more complex projects to solidify our understanding of React.
