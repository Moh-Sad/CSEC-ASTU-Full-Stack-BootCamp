### Front-End:
- **HTML:** Structure and content of web pages.
- **CSS:** Styling and presentation of web pages.
- **JavaScript:** Dynamic behavior and interactivity on web pages.
- **React:** A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Next.js:** A React framework for building server-rendered and statically generated websites and applications.

### Back-End:
- **Node.js:** JavaScript runtime environment for building server-side applications.
- **Express.js:** A fast and minimalist web application framework for Node.js.

### Database:
- **MySQL:** A popular open-source relational database management system.

## Day 3: HTML, CSS, Flexbox, and Grid

On Day 3, we learned about the **basics of HTML and CSS**, their definitions, structure, and use. Here's a quick summary:  
- **HTML**: The standard language for creating web pages, defining their structure and content.  
- **CSS**: Used for styling HTML elements, making web pages visually appealing.  

### Key Topics:
- **Flexbox and Grid**: Techniques for creating flexible and responsive layouts.  
- **Responsive Design**: Ensuring websites look good and function well on various devices and screen sizes.

We also solved **practice exercises** to strengthen our understanding of these concepts.  

---

## Day 4: Responsiveness and Media Queries

On Day 4, we focused on creating **responsive web designs** using **media queries**.  
Responsive design ensures that web pages adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes and devices.

### Key Topics Practiced:
- **Media Queries**: CSS rules to apply styles based on device characteristics like width, height, and orientation.  
- **Responsive Navbar**: Designed a navigation bar that adjusts its layout for mobile and desktop views.  
- **Responsive Cards**: Created visually appealing card components that reflow based on screen size.  

We also completed a task to prepare a **responsive navbar and card layout** to consolidate our learnings.

## Day 5: Basics of JavaScript and ES6 Features

Today, we dove into the basics of **JavaScript** and explored the features introduced in **ES6**. Here's a summary of what we learned:

### Key Concepts:
- **Scope in JavaScript**:  
  - **Global Scope**: Variables accessible from anywhere in the code.  
  - **Local Scope**: Variables declared within a block, function, or module, limited to that context.  

- **`let` vs. `const` vs. `var`**:  
  - **`let`**: Block-scoped, can be reassigned.  
  - **`const`**: Block-scoped, must be initialized and cannot be reassigned.  
  - **`var`**: Function-scoped, has hoisting behavior.

- **Logical Operators**:  
  - **`==` (Equality Operator)**: Compares values after type coercion.  
  - **`===` (Strict Equality Operator)**: Compares values without type coercion (checks both value and type).  

### Tasks and Exercises:
- Solved a **swapping variables** task.  
- Practiced **verbal and practical problem-solving** by answering and implementing JavaScript-related questions.

This hands-on practice helped reinforce our understanding of JavaScript's foundational concepts. Looking forward to building more interactive applications as we progress!

## Day 6: JavaScript DOM Manipulation

On Day 6, we explored the **Document Object Model (DOM)** and learned how to manipulate it using JavaScript.  

### Key Topics Covered:
- **Understanding the DOM**: The structured representation of HTML as nodes and objects.  
- **DOM Methods**:  
  - **`querySelector`**: Selects the first matching element.  
  - **`querySelectorAll`**: Selects all matching elements.  
  - **`getElementById`**: Selects an element by its ID.  
  - **`getElementsByClassName`**: Selects elements by their class name.  

- **Event Handling**:  
  - **`onclick`**: Handling click events dynamically.  

### Practical Exercises:
- Practiced changing **`innerHTML`** dynamically using **`onclick`** and **`querySelector`**.  

### Task Pending:
- We will complete a task to create an interactive feature where users input email and password details, and JavaScript validates and displays them dynamically using DOM manipulation.

## Day 7: UI Design and Figma Integration

Today, we focused on **UI design** by working on a Figma project and creating a **To-Do List** application using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

### Key Activities:
- **UI Design Practice**:  
  - Explored a **Figma project** to understand design workflows.  
  - Learned how to export assets and designs from Figma for implementation.  

- **Development Practice**:  
  - Built a **To-Do List application** as a hands-on project.  
  - Integrated HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity.  

- **Problem-Solving**:  
  - Discussed challenges faced during development.  
  - Collaborated with peers to resolve issues and referred to **Stack Overflow** for additional insights.  

### Highlights:
- It was a fantastic session that combined design and development.  
- Strengthened our understanding of the process from **design to implementation**.

## Day 8: Adding Functionality to the UI Project

Building on the **To-Do List application** we created on Day 7, today we focused on enhancing its functionality using **JavaScript**. The goal was to make the project more interactive, user-friendly, and visually appealing.

### Key Features Added:
1. **Interactive Buttons**:  
   - Used **event listeners** to handle user interactions.  
   - Applied **onclick handlers** for actions like adding, editing, and deleting tasks.  
   - Improved user experience with **cursor pointer styles** for better visual feedback.

2. **Dark and Light Mode Toggle**:  
   - Implemented a toggle switch that allows users to switch between dark and light modes.  
   - Used **JavaScript DOM manipulation** to dynamically update styles.  
   - Ensured the theme state persists during interactions.

3. **User-Friendly Design Enhancements**:  
   - Improved the layout and added animations for task addition and deletion.  
   - Made the project familiar and intuitive by simplifying the user flow.  

### Development Insights:
- **Problem-Solving**:  
  We encountered challenges when synchronizing dark and light modes with other elements, such as buttons and text. Through collaboration and debugging, we resolved these issues effectively.  

- **Best Practices**:  
  Learned the importance of keeping the code modular and reusable, especially when adding new features.  

### Highlights:
This session was fantastic! We successfully added meaningful functionality to our UI project, making it engaging and easy to use.  

### Gratitude:
What makes this journey more amazing is that weâ€™re continuing with our lessons despite the final exams. A big thank you to the **CSEC ASTU Division Team** for their unwavering support and guidance!
