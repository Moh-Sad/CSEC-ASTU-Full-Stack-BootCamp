# CSEC-ASTU Full-Stack BootCamp

Welcome to my journey with the **CSEC-ASTU Development Division**! ðŸŽ‰  
This is where I'll document my experiences, learnings, and projects from the **2-month Full-Stack Development BootCamp**.

## About the BootCamp

- **Duration**: 2 months  
- **Focus**: Full-Stack Development  
- **Hosted by**: CSEC-ASTU Development Division  

---

## Day 1: Learning Git and GitHub

We kicked off the BootCamp by diving into **Git** and **GitHub**:  
- **Git**: A distributed version control system used for tracking changes in source code during software development.  
- **GitHub**: A cloud-based platform for hosting Git repositories and collaborating on code.

### Commands Practiced:
- **commit**: Save changes to the local repository.  
- **push**: Upload local repository changes to a remote repository.  
- **pull**: Fetch and merge changes from a remote repository.  
- **branch**: Create and manage branches for version control.  
- **stage**: Prepare changes for committing.

## Day 2: BootCamp Roadmap

Today, we outlined the exciting journey ahead in the BootCamp. The curriculum covers a wide range of essential technologies for full-stack development:

### Front-End:
- **HTML:** Structure and content of web pages.
- **CSS:** Styling and presentation of web pages.
- **JavaScript:** Dynamic behavior and interactivity on web pages.
- **React:** A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Next.js:** A React framework for building server-rendered and statically generated websites and applications.

### Back-End:
- **Node.js:** JavaScript runtime environment for building server-side applications.
- **Express.js:** A fast and minimalist web application framework for Node.js.

### Database:
- **MySQL:** A popular open-source relational database management system.

## Day 3: HTML, CSS, Flexbox, and Grid

On Day 3, we learned about the **basics of HTML and CSS**, their definitions, structure, and use. Here's a quick summary:  
- **HTML**: The standard language for creating web pages, defining their structure and content.  
- **CSS**: Used for styling HTML elements, making web pages visually appealing.  

### Key Topics:
- **Flexbox and Grid**: Techniques for creating flexible and responsive layouts.  
- **Responsive Design**: Ensuring websites look good and function well on various devices and screen sizes.

We also solved **practice exercises** to strengthen our understanding of these concepts.

## Day 4: Responsiveness and Media Queries

On Day 4, we focused on creating **responsive web designs** using **media queries**.  
Responsive design ensures that web pages adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes and devices.

### Key Topics Practiced:
- **Media Queries**: CSS rules to apply styles based on device characteristics like width, height, and orientation.  
- **Responsive Navbar**: Designed a navigation bar that adjusts its layout for mobile and desktop views.  
- **Responsive Cards**: Created visually appealing card components that reflow based on screen size.  

We also completed a task to prepare a **responsive navbar and card layout** to consolidate our learnings.

## Day 5: Basics of JavaScript and ES6 Features

Today, we dove into the basics of **JavaScript** and explored the features introduced in **ES6**. Here's a summary of what we learned:

### Key Concepts:
- **Scope in JavaScript**:  
  - **Global Scope**: Variables accessible from anywhere in the code.  
  - **Local Scope**: Variables declared within a block, function, or module, limited to that context.  

- **`let` vs. `const` vs. `var`**:  
  - **`let`**: Block-scoped, can be reassigned.  
  - **`const`**: Block-scoped, must be initialized and cannot be reassigned.  
  - **`var`**: Function-scoped, has hoisting behavior.

- **Logical Operators**:  
  - **`==` (Equality Operator)**: Compares values after type coercion.  
  - **`===` (Strict Equality Operator)**: Compares values without type coercion (checks both value and type).  

### Tasks and Exercises:
- Solved a **swapping variables** task.  
- Practiced **verbal and practical problem-solving** by answering and implementing JavaScript-related questions.

This hands-on practice helped reinforce our understanding of JavaScript's foundational concepts. Looking forward to building more interactive applications as we progress!
