## Day 1: Learning Git and GitHub

We kicked off the BootCamp by diving into **Git** and **GitHub**:  
- **Git**: A distributed version control system used for tracking changes in source code during software development.  
- **GitHub**: A cloud-based platform for hosting Git repositories and collaborating on code.

### Commands Practiced:
- **commit**: Save changes to the local repository.  
- **push**: Upload local repository changes to a remote repository.  
- **pull**: Fetch and merge changes from a remote repository.  
- **branch**: Create and manage branches for version control.  
- **stage**: Prepare changes for committing.
