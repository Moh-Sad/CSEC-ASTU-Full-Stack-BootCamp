## About the Project

**Job Sphere** is a web application designed to help job seekers find opportunities and employers post job listings. The project is part of the **CSEC-ASTU Full-Stack BootCamp**, where we are learning to build full-stack applications using modern technologies.

This project is located in the **React** folder of the **CSEC-ASTU-FULL-STACK_BOOTCAMP** repository under the **Job Sphere** folder. It showcases the integration of **React** for building components, **Figma** for design, and **Tailwind CSS** for styling.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The application is fully responsive and works seamlessly on various devices and screen sizes.
- **Reusable Components**: Built using React's component-based architecture for reusability and maintainability.
- **Modern UI**: Designed in Figma and implemented using Tailwind CSS for a sleek and modern user interface.
- **Dynamic Routing**: Utilizes React Router for navigation between different pages.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **React Router**: For handling navigation and routing in the application.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
